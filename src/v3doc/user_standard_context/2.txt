v3d is a Lua based 3D rendering library for ComputerCraft.
ComputerCraft is a minecraft mod adding programmable computers to the game.

v3d has 5 main parts:
* Types specify the structure of values used by v3d, for example in images.
* Images contain 1D/2D/3D pixel data. They can be rendered to and drawn (presented) to the screen.
* Geometry contains 3D mesh data and can be rendered to images.
* Transforms specify 3D affine transformations used to transform vertices when rendering.
* Pipelines are optimised, specialised functions. There are a range of types to do different things.
