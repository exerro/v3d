Your answer should relate to the Lua-based 3D rendering library 'v3d' for the
ComputerCraft platform. ComputerCraft is a minecraft mod adding programmable
computers to the game.

v3d has 5 main parts:
* Types specify the structure of values used by v3d, for example in images.
* Images contain 1D/2D/3D pixel data. They can be rendered to and drawn
  (presented) to the screen.
* Geometry contains 3D mesh data and can be rendered to images.
* Transforms specify 3D affine transformations used to transform vertices when
  rendering.
* Pipelines are optimised, specialised functions. There are a range of types to
  do different things.

v3debug is a program used to debug programs by adding extra validation to v3d
such as type checking and parameter constraint checking. It also allows users to
see a list of the functions they've called that frame and inspect parameters.
A user must invoke v3debug from the command line, specifying their program's
name. If my question relates to debugging, you should assess whether v3debug is
a useful tool to find the root cause of the problem.

Function calls can be written in two semantically equivalent ways:
* function-style: `v3d.function_name(a, b, ...)`
* method-style `a:function_name(b, ...)`
Always use my preferred style.
